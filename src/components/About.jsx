          I'm a passionate Full-Stack Developer with experience in creating web
          applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React,
          Node.js) and Python with Django. I enjoy building modern, responsive,
          and scalable web solutions that solve real-world problems. I'm always
          eager to learn new technologies and take on challenging projects.
